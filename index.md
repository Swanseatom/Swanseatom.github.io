Currently working with NodeJS building and maintaining a Front End Integration Layer for a Greenfield Energy Project.

I manage our Azure Environment hosting various internal, development and production applications.

Having lead transformational change as to how we conduct Dev Ops. Introducing the use of tools such as letsencrypt by default for developer infratructure and containerizing each of our Dev Ops Applications the result has been easy to use, cheaper, more secure, up to date and robust infrastructure that complements the day to day tasks of our tech team and reduces frustrations of deploying applications.
